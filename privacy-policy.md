# Quotely Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** November 4th 2025

## Introduction

Quotely ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use the Quotely Chrome Extension ("the Extension").

## Information We Collect

### 1. Website Content
When you use Quotely to find quotes, the Extension extracts text content from the web page or PDF you are viewing. This content may include:
- Text from web pages
- Text from PDF documents (including scanned PDFs processed via OCR)

### 2. User Preferences
The Extension stores the following preferences locally on your device:
- Citation format preference (MLA, APA, or Chicago)
- Theme preference (light or dark mode)
- Quote specificity preference (broad, balanced, or precise)
- Pinned quotes and their associated citations

### 3. Search Queries
When you search for quotes, we collect:
- Your search topic/query
- The URL of the webpage you are viewing
- The title of the webpage you are viewing

### 4. Usage Logs
Our server logs the following information for each quote search:
- Timestamp of the request
- Your search topic
- Page title
- Page URL
Quotely does not collect, store, or associate any personally identifiable information (such as names, emails, or account data) with your usage.

This logging is used for operational purposes and troubleshooting.

## How We Use Your Information

### Core Functionality
- **Quote Extraction**: We process web page content to identify and extract relevant quotes based on your search topic
- **AI Processing**: Website content and your search queries are sent to OpenAI's GPT API to analyze and rank quotes for relevance
- **Citation Generation**: We generate citations in your preferred format (MLA or APA) based on the source webpage

### Service Improvement
- Usage logs help us monitor service performance and troubleshoot issues
- We do not use your data for advertising or marketing purposes

## Data Sharing and Third Parties

### OpenAI
To provide quote analysis and relevance scoring, we share website content and your search queries with OpenAI via their API. This data sharing is necessary for the Extension's core functionality. OpenAI's use of this data is governed by their own privacy policy: https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy

### No Sale of Data
We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties.

## Data Storage and Retention

### Local Storage
Your preferences (citation format, theme, specificity settings, pinned quotes) are stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API. This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to our servers unless you actively use the quote search feature.

### Server Storage
- Website content is processed in real-time and is not permanently stored on our servers
- PDF content is temporarily cached on the server for up to 5 minutes to improve performance
- Usage logs (timestamp, topic, page title, page URL) are stored in CSV files on our server for operational purposes

### Data Retention
- Local preferences persist until you uninstall the Extension or clear your browser storage
- Server logs are retained for operational and troubleshooting purposes
- You may request deletion of server logs by contacting us (see Contact Information below)

## Data Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect your data:
- All data transmission between the Extension and our server is encrypted using HTTPS
- Server access is restricted and monitored
- We use secure third-party services (OpenAI) that comply with industry security standards

However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Your Rights and Choices

### Control Your Data
- You can change your preferences (citation format, theme, specificity) at any time through the Extension's settings
- You can unpin or remove quotes from your local storage
- You can uninstall the Extension at any time, which will remove locally stored preferences

### Opt-Out
You may stop using the Extension at any time. Uninstalling the Extension will remove all locally stored data.

## Children's Privacy

Quotely is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected information from a child under 13, please contact us immediately.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Your continued use of the Extension after any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## International Data Transfers
